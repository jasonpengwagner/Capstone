# Capstone

This code uses the EOIR FOIA library to analyze the relationship of an immigrant's detention status and the court decision he/she received in immigration proceedings. 

The datasets used in the R codes are uploaded in the same folder. 

We sincerely thank Eric for providing us codes about his previous research, which is especially helpful for a R rookie like me. 

We also refer to the methodology a Buzzfeed study which uses the same dataset (in its older version), link: https://github.com/BuzzFeedNews/2015-08-immigrant-detention
