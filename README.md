This code uses the EOIR FOIA library to analyze the relationship of an immigrant's detention status and the court decision he/she received in immigration proceedings. 

The datasets used in the R codes can not be uploaded due to their sizes. They are available in the link: https://fileshare.eoir.justice.gov/FOIA-TRAC-Report.zip . The code book is https://www.justice.gov/eoir/page/file/eoir-case-data-code-key/download

We sincerely thank Eric for providing us codes about his previous research, which is especially helpful for a R rookie like me. 

We also refer to the methodology a Buzzfeed study which uses the same dataset (in its older version), link: https://github.com/BuzzFeedNews/2015-08-immigrant-detention
